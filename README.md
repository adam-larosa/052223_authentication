# Flask Authentication!

Can we prove we are who we say we are?

### Vocab!

+ **Cryptography**: The art of encoding data into a secret that only be read
by certain users.

+ **Encryption**: Being able to encode data to keep it secret, but the decode or "decrypt" the data to it can be read again

+ **Hash**: A "hash" is a one-way encryption, where a string can be encoded
into a hash, then the same string can be checked to see if it would generate
the same hash.

+ **Collision**: When a hashing algorithm creates the same hash for two different strings.

+ **Rainbow Table**: A pre-made list of hashes created using common password
string and popular hashing algorithms.

+ **Salt**: The addition of another random string on top of any string we're 
making a hash from.
